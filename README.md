Datacron
======

Flask-based web application that uses the (SWAPI.co)[http://swapi.co] API to look up Star Wars characters, their homeworld, and the planet's population and climate. Meant to be deployed using either (Docker)[https://www.docker.com/] or (Zappa)[https://github.com/MiserLou/zappa], my preferred.

Thanks to SWAPI.co for the use of their (API Documentation)[https://swapi.co/documentation], to Paul Harllett for his (swapi-python)[https://github.com/phalt/swapi-python] library, and Jason Leckie for the challenge to build this app.
